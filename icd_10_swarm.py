    DISCHARGE SUMMARY

    Patient: John Smith
    MRN: 12345678
    DOB: 01/15/1962
    Admission Date: 06/10/2023
    Discharge Date: 06/15/2023

    FINAL DIAGNOSES:
    1. Acute exacerbation of chronic systolic congestive heart failure
    2. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction
    3. Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy, estimated GFR 42
    4. Hypertension
    5. Hyperlipidemia

    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
    The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (EF 35% on prior echo 3 months ago) who presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient reported chest pressure while walking to the bathroom. Initial troponin was elevated at 0.15 ng/mL, with subsequent rise to 0.25 ng/mL, consistent with NSTEMI. BNP was significantly elevated at 1,250 pg/mL.

    HOSPITAL COURSE:
    The patient was admitted to the cardiac care unit. He was treated with IV furosemide with good diuretic response, losing 3.5 liters of fluid during hospitalization. Cardiology was consulted and performed a left heart catheterization, which revealed 70% stenosis in the mid-LAD with PCI and drug-eluting stent placement. The patient's symptoms improved significantly with diuresis and coronary intervention.

    His diabetes was managed with insulin during the hospitalization, with blood glucose ranging from 130-210 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted regarding his diabetic nephropathy and recommended adjustment of medications appropriate for his renal function.

    PROCEDURES:
    1. Left heart catheterization with percutaneous coronary intervention and drug-eluting stent placement to mid-LAD (06/12/2023)

    DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
    1. Lisinopril 10 mg daily
    2. Carvedilol 12.5 mg twice daily
    3. Spironolactone 25 mg daily
    4. Furosemide 40 mg twice daily
    5. Atorvastatin 80 mg daily
    6. Aspirin 81 mg daily
    7. Clopidogrel 75 mg daily
    8. Insulin glargine 20 units nightly
    9. Insulin lispro sliding scale before meals

    DISCHARGE PLAN:
    1. Follow-up with cardiology in 2 weeks
    2. Follow-up with primary care physician in 1 week
    3. Follow-up with nephrology in 3 weeks
    4. Daily weights, 2 gram sodium diet, fluid restriction to 1.5 liters daily
